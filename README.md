MonoTouch Samples
=================

The samples in this directory use the MonoTouch toolchain and
MonoDevelop project files to illustrate the basics of how to
work with iOS and the SDK.

Before adding a sample to the repository, please run either install-hook.bat
or install-hook.sh depending on whether you're on Windows or a Posix system.
This will install a Git hook that runs the Xamarin code sample validator before
a commit, to ensure that all samples are good to go.
