This sample shows how to use OpenGL in your application using the
high-level iPhoneOSGameView base class (this class derives from
UIView) and simplifies a lot of the code to set up the GL context.

Contrast this with the lower-level version available in OpenGLESSample
that derives directly from UIView and has to create and destroy the
rendering buffer manually.
