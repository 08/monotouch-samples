This sample illustrates how to use AudioToolbox's AudioFileStream to 
parse an audio stream progressively and play the audio back.

The audio is a creative commons MP3 file that is downloaded from a
website using Mono's HTTP stack.

This code does not attempt to buffer beyond the four built-in buffers
that are created at startup.   It will happily stall until the audio
pipeline releases one of the audio buffers.

A better implementation would save the data to disk as well.

To use this you need either MonoTouch 1.4 or to download the preview
monotouch.dll from:
