This is an all-in-one sample demonstrating various user interface
elements, such as the address book, alerts, buttons, images, pickers,
search bars, text fields/views, toolbars, transitions, and web views.


How to build
============

From a terminal windows simply do:

$ make

to build the application. To launch it inside the iOS simulator do:

$ make launch

If you're not using the iOS 5.1 SDK then you need to edit the 
IOS_SDK_VERSION variable inside the ../Make.common file.
