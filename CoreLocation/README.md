Core Location
=============

This sample illustrates how to retrieve location, orientation, and velocity
data from the device using the Core Location API exposed in MonoTouch. It
covers initializing the CLLocationManager, configuring update frequency and
accuracy, and receiving updates using both the event and delegate pattern.
It also illustrates how to retrieve "Distance To" information.
