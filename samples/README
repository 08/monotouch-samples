	The samples in this directory use the MonoTouch toolchain and
	Unix Makefiles as we wanted to illustrate the basics of how to
	work with the SDK. 

	There is a sample MonoDevelop project as well called
	"monocatalog-md".  It is the same project as "monocatalog",
	but written as a MonoDevelop solution.
