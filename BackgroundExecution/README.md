Core Animation
=================

This sample illustrates how to develop multitasking (background execution)
aware applications in MonoTouch. The AppDelegate class illustrates the
application lifecycle methods that should be overridden in order to gracefully
handle state changes. Additionally, it illustrates how to register a long
running task that will finish executing even though the app is put in a
background state.

The home screen has a button that will launch a background task that will
execute even if the app is backgrounded.
