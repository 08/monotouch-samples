AQTapDemo
=========

This sample shows how to use the new iOS 6 AudioQueue Processing Taps.
With Audio Processing Taps, you can either apply effects to your audio
or analize data as it is being decoded.

This sample is a port of Chris Adamson's AQTapDemo from CocoaConf
which he has been kind enough to license under the MIT X11 license.
Marek Safar implemented the Xamarin.iOS/Xamarin.Mac support for
AudioQueueProcessingTap as well as the new AudioUnit stack and ported
the original Objective-C code to C#.
